sample_00001832,担忧,worried,最好还是跟曾主任说一声，万一他要是找你。,"It's better to let Director Zeng know, just in case he wants to find you."
sample_00001178,生气,angry,曹小强，我警告你，你如果再敢纠缠我们家微澜，我真跟你没完。,"Cao Xiaoqiang, I warn you, if you dare to bother our family Weilan again, I will really not let you off."

sample_00001697,生气,angry,啊。,Ah.
sample_00000907,悲伤,sad,装三好女婿，从来都是媳妇骂我妈，我不敢骂她妈。买盆酱油，还怀疑你吃回扣。,"Being a good son-in-law, I always get scolded by my wife for my mother, but I dare not scold her mother. When buying a bottle of soy sauce, I even suspect that you are taking a kickback."

sample_00000370,高兴,happy,算了吧，在这些人眼里，我只是他们的赚钱机器。,"Forget it, in their eyes, I'm just their money-making machine."
sample_00007011,生气,angry,我现在要回家，我可以走了吗？,"I'm going home now, can I leave?"
sample_00006709,生气,angry,可是你懂不懂自己为什么活着？你每次笑是为了什么？,But do you know why you are alive? What are you laughing for every time?
sample_00001453,高兴,happy,看看，真是母女连心，什么事都想着干妈。,"Look, they are really close like mother and daughter, always thinking about their godmother."
sample_00004446,生气,angry,有钱怎么了？你们有钱，你们有钱就可以侮辱人哪。,"What's wrong with having money? If you have money, you can insult people."
sample_00004307,悲伤,sad,我都不知道怎么跟你解释？这大概就是一个意外吧。,I don't know how to explain it to you. This is probably an accident.
sample_00006941,悲伤,sad,你在哪儿我还能不知道？我是来向你道歉的。昨天晚上我真的失态了。对不起，好吗？,"Where are you? How could I not know? I came to apologize to you. I really lost control last night. I'm sorry, okay?"

sample_00004053,高兴,happy,原来这两个人是郎情妾意呀。,It turns out that these two people are deeply in love.
sample_00001039,生气,angry,那你也等会儿吧，没工夫给你挪车，我这儿忙着呢我。,"Then you wait for a while too, I don't have time to move your car, I'm busy here."
sample_00000361,担忧,worried,男人的心态我了解，那太容易得到的就不容易珍惜。别再回头有一天，挥一挥手，不带走一片云彩。,"I understand the mentality of men, it is not easy to cherish what is easily obtained. Don't look back one day, wave goodbye, and not take away a single cloud."
sample_00005079,高兴,happy,nan,nan
sample_00002298,生气,angry,那是我一分钱一分钱修车攒出来的。我问你，我让你少吃过一顿肉吗？,"That's the money I saved up bit by bit to fix the car. I ask you, have I ever asked you to eat less meat?"

sample_00002244,生气,angry,如果没有一种信念，我怎么能熬的过来？,"If there is no belief, how can I survive?"
sample_00006914,生气,angry,哎，我这是在家啊。我还穿什么周武郑王的，我连孩子的房间都不能进么？,"Oh, I am at home. What should I wear? Can't I even enter my child's room?"
sample_00006884,生气,angry,不管我走到哪儿，看到的都是笑脸，听到的都是好话，就这么一夜之间，所有人见了我都怪模怪样的。我这心里能好受吗？,"No matter where I go, all I see are smiling faces and hear kind words. But overnight, everyone I meet looks at me strangely. Can I feel good in my heart?"
sample_00006689,生气,angry,我不管你是谁，你只要敢欺负我弟弟我就剁了你。,"I don't care who you are, as long as you dare to bully my younger brother, I will chop you up."
sample_00000153,高兴,happy,白总监，你也关注这件事啊！,"Director Bai, you are also paying attention to this matter!"
